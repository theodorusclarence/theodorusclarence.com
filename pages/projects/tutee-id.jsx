              This project was made using React, Redux, and Firebase. This
              project was needed rapidly so building a backend application will
              take too much time. So we use firebase for the backend using
              Firestore and Firebase Storage to store profile pictures. I am
              responsible for making the landing page, search tutor page, and
              session page.

            <h3>First Collaborative Project</h3>
            <p>
              This is my very first collaborative project with 3 other people
              and I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot about git workflow to
              merge code and other stuff for contributing. I actually learned
              how to close vim in this project üòÇ. I enjoyed working in a group
              because I get a lot of knowledge and get a chance to share mine
              too.
            </p>
            <h3>Complex Project</h3>
            <p>
              This is quite a complex project with a lot of entities and
              database optimization because we are using firebase and trying to
              minimize hit as much as possible.

              <h2>The Problems and How I Deal With It</h2>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In this project, there are a lot of problems that I found. This is
              my first time working with a complex data flow using Redux. I have
              a significant time googling on the internet on how to do things. I
              also make use of useEffect hooks to preprocess the data that was
              fetched.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, folder management and CSS reusability are really hard for me
              in doing this collaborative project because we didn't use any CSS
              framework or prepared utility classes. I think there is a lot of
              redundancy in the CSS and can be fixed
            </p>

            <br />

            <blockquote>
              <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I learned a lot from this project. I solidified my knowledge in
              using useEffect, and get a chance to put my CSS skills to
              practice. I work mostly on the more complex page to build
              CSS-wise, and I finally put a lot of CSS properties like absolute,
              sticky, overflow in this project. Creating the navbar is also
              challenging because I want to use position: sticky, and it doesn't
              allow it to have overflow property.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned great practice on managing version control with gitlab,
              by using staging and production branches. This is a great and fun
              first project, that really strengthen my skill
            </p>
