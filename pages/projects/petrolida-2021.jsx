              This project objective is to give information and guide the user
              to register for the competitions and the other pre-event through
              google forms. There are four kinds that are developed in the
              website which are Landing Page to give the user general knowledge
              about the event. Then, there are 7 competitions that were made
              into different routes each one. Lastly is the pre-event such as
              the talk show.

              This project was made using Next.js and Tailwindcss. Although this
              is fairly only a static website that didn't really need much
              complexity, using Next.js really simplifies the routing of the
              website and help me make reusable components. I usually use
              tailwindcss when using the Next.js framework to increase
              productivity.

              <h2>The Problems and How I Deal With It</h2>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              In this project, the problem that I found was that the domain that
              was given and needed to use its old and kind of hard to configure.
              Eventually, I only host the static files and ditch out the Image
              Optimization feature from Next.js. It was not ideal, because I
              need to optimize images that are being used to increase loading
              speed.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also struggled with implementing ScrollTrigger with GSAP because
              there are not many blogs or tutorials on Google, so I take the
              chance on reading the documentation to make it work.
            </p>

              <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This is my first website for an event so I really consider a lot
              how to do a great practice on SEO, I discovered a library called{' '}
              <CustomLink href='https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo'>
                next-seo
              </CustomLink>{' '}
              that helped a lot on configuring SEO using Next.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this project, I anticipated that there will be many revisions
              because that is what usually happens, so I try to reduce writing
              HTML and make everything based on the data, so I store the data in
              a javascript file and just map it out to the layout. This makes
              revising much quicker and easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project really taught me a lot about making a cleaner code
              and make the development process more effective by using some
              library that helps.
