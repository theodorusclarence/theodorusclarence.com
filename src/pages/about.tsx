                  Hello! I'm Clarence. I started learning web development in May
                  2020, which is the start of the pandemic. I have nothing much
                  to do so I decided to learn web development from a udemy
                  course, then started watching a bunch of{' '}
                  <CustomLink href='/blog/youtube-list'>
                    youtube videos
                  </CustomLink>{' '}
                  to explore more about web development especially frontend
                  development.
                </p>
                <p data-fade='4'>
                  There are a lot of things and technologies to learn in
                  frontend development and I am motivated to learn as much as
                  possible. I enjoy learning something new and getting feedback
                  to make myself better and improve.
                </p>
                <p data-fade='5'>
                  In this website I will be writing some blogs and showcase my
                  projects. I believe that writing what I have learned is the
                  best way to remember things, and I can share my knowledge
                  along the way. So do contact me and I will be very happy to
                  help!
