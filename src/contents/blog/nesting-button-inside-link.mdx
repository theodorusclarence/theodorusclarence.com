## Introduction

If you have ever used Linear. You might notice that they use a link for their kanban item

  alt='Linear kanban is using a link for the their kanban item'
  width={500}
  height={527}
/>

But itâ€™s also interactable

  width={400}
  height={343}
/>

If you ever tried to build this, you might found some problem. Thatâ€™s probably the reason you came across this article. Itâ€™s not entirely straightforward to nest an interactive button inside a link. How is that possible?

### HTML5 Spec Disclaimer

Just for disclaimer, itâ€™s actually not recommended to have a button nested inside an `<a>` tag.

> The a element may be wrapped around entire paragraphs, lists, tables, and so forth, even entire sections, so long as there is no interactive content within (e.g. buttons or other links).

Iâ€™m not well-versed on the a11y side of the web. But this link and nested interactive is getting more popular since linear used the same pattern.

### If it has to be done

If your designer/PM said to ignore the spec and **it has to be done**. I got the solution.

Iâ€™m gonna walk you through the attempts that I made, and the flaws each step until I make the current working solution.

Note: My examples is going to use React. But it will be the same with any framework, because itâ€™s purely DOM operations.

## First Mundane Attempt

Itâ€™s quite natural to reach to this solution using markup

```jsx
<a href='https://theodorusclarence.com'>
  hello this is a link
  <button onClick={open}>open combobox</button>
</a>
```

However, youâ€™re gonna get quickly disappointed because when you have a button inside a link, the link default behavior will take precedence. Thus, clicking the button will send you directly to the link instead of doing the `onClick`.

## Preventing Default

You can actually stop the `<a>` from redirecting by using `e.preventDefault` .

```jsx
<a href='https://theodorusclarence.com' onClick={(e) => e.preventDefault()}>
  hello this is a link
  <button onClick={() => alert('open combobox')}>open combobox</button>
</a>
```

By preventing the default behavior, we wonâ€™t be redirected to the link.

<CloudinaryVideoPlayer
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/nesting-button-inside-link/preventing-default'
  width={400}
  height={380}
/>

That means, we can selectively prevent the default behavior when we are clicking a **button**.

```tsx
<a
  href='https://theodorusclarence.com'
  onClick={(e) => {
    if (e.target instanceof HTMLElement && e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
      e.preventDefault();
    }
  }}
>
  hello this is a link{' '}
  <button onClick={() => alert('open combobox')}>(open combobox)</button>
</a>
```

That works right? Or is it ðŸ¤¨?

## Putting icons inside a button

Itâ€™s very common for a button to have icons inside, or maybe other elements like span and stuff.

This is where another problem comes.

```tsx
<a
  href='https://theodorusclarence.com'
  onClick={(e) => {
    if (e.target instanceof HTMLElement && e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') {
      e.preventDefault();
    }
  }}
>
  hello this is a link{' '}
  <button onClick={() => alert('open combobox')}>
    <svg width='12' height='12' viewBox='0 0 12 12'>
      <circle cx='6' cy='6' r='6' fill='currentColor' />
    </svg>
  </button>
</a>
```

<CloudinaryVideoPlayer
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/nesting-button-inside-link/icons-inside-buttons'
  width={400}
  height={464}
/>

It doesnâ€™t work.

If your button has svg inside, when we are checking the `e.target.tagName` it wonâ€™t detect as a button since we are actually clicking on the SVG element itself (`circle`)

  alt='CleanShot'
  width={500}
  height={358}
/>

## Solution: Recursive Check

The solution is to do a recursive check up to the parent.

```tsx
const checkIgnoreNestedLink = React.useCallback(
  (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLAnchorElement>) => {
    let cur = e.target as HTMLElement;

    while (cur) {
      if (cur.dataset?.ignoreNestedLink) {
        return true;
      }

      if (cur.parentElement) {
        cur = cur.parentElement;
      } else {
        break;
      }
    }

    return false;
  },
  []
);

return (
  <button
    onClick={(e) => {
      if (checkIgnoreNestedLink(e)) {
        e.preventDefault();
      }
    }}
  >
    <svg />
  </button>
);
```

This code will ensure that we check all of the element that we click, as well as all of the parent elements until we found `data-ignore-nested-link`.

To use it, you can just add the data attribute to the button that you have.

```tsx
<a>
  ...
  <button data-ignore-nested-link />
</a>
```

Note: If youâ€™re using Radix UI, you also need to add the attribute to the popover content/other element content.

## Conclusion

This will work since the check is guaranteed to be exhaustive. Good luck!
