## Introduction

I was doing a design revamp for this blog, and my designer came up with a button that looks like this.

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/Untitled'
  alt='Button with a gray gradient border and a translucent background'
  width={1286}
  height={774}
/>

Looks great, right?

I thought to myself, that would be simple enough to make: a button, with a transparent and blur background, and add in a gray-ish gradient border around it. Probably something like `border: 1px solid linear-gradient()` would definitely work.

Spoiler: I was wrong

## Border Gradient Attempt

So I set my goal, to build a proof of concept.

I whipped out a simple codepen, and created a button with a linear gradient border.

```css
button {
  all: unset;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2rem;

  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  background: #172554;
  color: white;

  border: 1px solid linear-gradient(to bottom right, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet);
}
```

That must be the most colorful gradient known to man. I was confident that it would work.

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/Untitled_1'
  alt='Button without a rainbow gradient border'
  width={1106}
  height={788}
/>

It must be a dry season because **I can‚Äôt see any rainbow!**

Yeah, turns out **linear-gradient does not work with border.**

## Stacked Element Method

As a seasoned problem solver, I went to google, searched ‚ÄúHow to make a gradient border in CSS‚Äù, and found an interesting method:

You basically create two divs, first is for the rainbow background, and second one is the button text itself. It sounds like a great idea.

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/Untitled_2'
  alt='Diagram of how stacked element method works'
  width={2534}
  height={1338}
/>

I updated my code using a pseudo element as a background.

```css
button {
  all: unset;
  position: relative;

  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2rem;

  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  background: #000;
  color: white;
  /* formula for 2 stacked radius is: (radius - (border-width / 2)) */
  border-radius: calc(12px - (2px / 2));
}

button::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  /* this is the border width */
  inset: -2px;
  z-index: -1;
  background: linear-gradient(
    to bottom right,
    red,
    orange,
    yellow,
    green,
    blue,
    indigo,
    violet
  );
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/Untitled_3'
  alt='Button with a rainbow gradient border'
  width={744}
  height={494}
/>

**IT WORKS!**

The code looks a bit complicated, but it does the job. I was really happy about it.

## Adding a transparent background

I continued my work by adding the transparent and blurred background.

```css
button {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(1px);
}
```

And it looks like this:

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/Untitled_4'
  alt='Button with a rainbow gradient background, but the border is gone'
  width={1256}
  height={816}
/>

Remember that we have a rainbow div behind? Introducing a translucent background means we will see the rainbow.

If you think that maybe we can try making a rainbow background with a hollow transparent background in the middle, that would be called **a gradient border üôÉ**. So we're back to square one.

## Ultimate Solution with Mask Exclude

So I did some more digging, and found the perfect solution that can cater all cases.

There‚Äôs a new property that‚Äôs recently gained a major support across browsers which is [mask-composite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-composite).

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/Untitled_5'
  alt='Button with a rainbow gradient background'
  width={2538}
  height={808}
/>

According to [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/mask-composite/), we can remove a certain part of element by creating mask with 2 elements on top of each other, and use mask-composite exclude.

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/css-tricks-exclude'
  alt='css-tricks-exclude'
  width={2294}
  height={1188}
/>

That means, if we create two boxes with one smaller than the other, we can have a mask that can show anything we like.

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/Untitled_7'
  alt='Mask Composite caniuse'
  width={2054}
  height={1514}
/>

With mask, the element's background will be reflected. This even includes background-image.

### Final Code

This is how the final code looks like!

```css
button {
  all: unset;
  position: relative;

  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 1rem;

  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
  backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
  color: white;
  border-radius: 12px;
}

button::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
  inset: 0px;

  border-radius: inherit;
  /* this is the border width */
  padding: 1px;
  background: linear-gradient(
    to bottom right,
    #171717 0%,
    #525252 62%,
    #171717 100%
  );
  -webkit-mask: linear-gradient(#fff 0 0) content-box, linear-gradient(#fff 0 0);
  mask: linear-gradient(#fff 0 0) content-box, linear-gradient(#fff 0 0);
  -webkit-mask-composite: xor;
  mask-composite: exclude;
}
```

## Final Words

There you have it! A working set of gradient border with translucent background. With this new widely-supported property, we can create anything that comes to mind.

Including something like this:

<CloudinaryVideoPlayer
  mdx
  publicId='theodorusclarence/blogs/gradient-border-is-hard/gradient-vid'
  width='1424'
  height='596'
/>

ps: I can‚Äôt open-source this because it‚Äôs from work ‚úåÔ∏è. But it's using the same method!
