> ## Short Explanation

Hexcape is a unique puzzle game that combines a digital experience with physical elements such as cards and a map. Players must work together as a team to progress through the story, which is inspired by Greek mythology and involves helping a girl become a demigod. The game uses various technologies to provide an immersive gaming experience, including QR codes, image recognition, ARKit, RealityKit, and SceneKit.

> ## Project Goals

As a team of board game lovers, we want to bring our love of board games to the next level by using innovative technologies such as QR codes, image recognition, ARKit, RealityKit, and SceneKit.

Our goal is to create a game that is engaging and immersive, allowing players to feel like they are truly part of the game world as they explore virtual locations, solve puzzles, and make decisions that affect the outcome of the game. We hope to achieve this goal by using a range of technologies to provide a unique and interactive gaming experience that will appeal to players of all ages. Ultimately, the goal of the Hexcape project is to create a game that is both enjoyable and challenging, providing players with an exciting and memorable gaming experience.

The Hexcape project uses a range of technologies, including:

- SwiftUI: a user interface framework used to design and build the user interface of the Hexcape app
- SceneKit: a 3D graphics framework used to manipulate and display 3D assets such as the 3D puzzle box
- ARKit: a kit for creating augmented reality experiences, used to display the low-poly 3D design of the underworld
- RealityKit: a kit for creating augmented reality and 3D experiences, used to provide 360-degree views of virtual locations
- WebKit: a kit for displaying web content within the app, used to display QR codes and other web-based elements
- Image Recognition: a technology used to identify and classify images, used to allow players to select locations within the Olympus map and trigger other interactive features.

We'll see the feature with the tech stack used in the next section.

### QR Code Scanning

One of the key features of Hexcape is the use of QR codes, which players can scan using the Hexcape app on their phone to unlock various features and look for clues. Scanning the QR code allows players to travel around the Olympus map and access other interactive elements within the game.

### Image Recognition

The Hexcape game uses image recognition technology to allow players to select locations within the Olympus map and move to different places. By scanning certain areas of the map, players can trigger events or access new locations within the game.

### Augmented Reality with ARKit

Hexcape uses ARKit to display a low-poly 3D design of the underworld, providing a creepy atmosphere for players to explore in search of clues. The game's use of ARKit allows players to feel like they are truly part of the game world as they explore the underworld and uncover hidden clues.

### 360 World with RealityKit

Hexcape includes 360 World using RealityKit, which allows players to fully explore virtual locations such as Aphrodite's temple and search for clues. The game's use of RealityKit provides an immersive gaming experience, making players feel like they are truly part of the game world.

### Interactive 3D Puzzle Box

Hexcape includes a highly interactive 3D puzzle box that players can manipulate and interact with in various ways. The 3D box is designed to be highly interactive, allowing players to engage with it in various ways such as zooming in-n-out, rotating, and tapping while feeling the haptic feedback. The game's use of SceneKit allows players to feel like they are actually opening and solving the puzzle box in real life.

### Multiple Endings

As players progress through the game and solve the puzzles, they will reach either the True Ending or the Bad Ending. This feature adds an element of choice to the game, making players feel like their decisions matter as they ultimately determine the ending they receive.

It's a great recognition of all our efforts and a testament to the quality and uniqueness of Hexcape.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Developing the Hexcape project has definitely come with its share of challenges. Managing time effectively has been one of the main struggles, especially when working with a team. Coordinating schedules and making sure everyone is on the same page can be tough. Another challenge has been deciding on the materials to use in the game. With so many different options available, it can be hard to decide which technologies and tools will be the most effective in creating the desired gameplay experience.

The team has had to consider a range of factors, including the cost of materials, the level of complexity involved in using them, and the level of immersion and interactivity that they can provide. Finally, finding a good game mechanic that is both engaging and challenging has also been a challenge. The team has had to experiment with different gameplay elements and test them with players in order to find the right balance between challenge and enjoyment.

> ## Lessons Learned

Working on the Hexcape project has been a fantastic learning experience, and the team has learned a lot of valuable lessons along the way. One of the key lessons learned was the importance of time management. With a tight timeline of just two months, it was essential that the team stay organized and focused in order to complete the project on time.

Another important lesson learned was the value of thorough product research. In order to select the right materials for the game's cards, the team had to do a lot of research to determine the best options for durability, cost, and appearance. This research was essential in helping the team to make informed decisions and ultimately create a high-quality product.

Finally, I learned a lot about the process of creating a game from scratch. From designing and illustrating the game's assets to implementing all of the interactive features, there was a lot of work involved in bringing Hexcape to life. It was a challenging and rewarding process, and the team learned a lot about what it takes to create a successful game. Overall, working on the Hexcape project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I am very proud of the final product.
