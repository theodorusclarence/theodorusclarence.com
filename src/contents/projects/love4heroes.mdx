> ## Short Explanation

This app was created as a team for uOttaHack, Canada in 36 hours. When
thinking about how we could make a difference within local communities
impacted by Covid-19, what came to mind are our frontline workers. Our
doctors, nurses, grocery store workers, and Covid-19 testing
volunteers, who have tirelessly been putting themselves and their
families on the line. They are the backbone and heartbeat of our
society during these past 10 months and counting. We want them to feel
the appreciation and gratitude they deserve. With this app, we hope to
bring moments of positivity and joy to those difficult and trying
moments of our frontline workers.

> ## Project Goals

This project was made so the user is able to create a card and can
save the card as a link, then the user can send the link to their
loved frontline workers. The frontline workers can also see all of the
cards on the "Warm Messages" Board.

This project was built using Next.js, Tailwindcss, SWR, and Firebase.
Personally, I think using these stacks is a great choice due to the
lack of time and for simplicity. We only use the firebase for the
firestore because it is simple to configure. Next.js is also a great
choice because we can mix and match the rendering type that we are
using. For the dynamic content such as rendering the card's data from
firestore, we use client-side rendering and utilizing SWR to cache the
data.

> ## Spotlight

### First Hackathon With 12 Hour Time-Zone Difference & Tight Time

In this project, I collaborated with 3 other teams that live in
America. It's quite a challenge for me to fit in into their timezone
so we can still work together. Also, there are only 36 hours to finish
a functioning full-stack application.

### Consideration for UX

We incorporated a library to simulate flipping cards, but sometimes
the user didn't open it while editing. So we decided to make a UX
improvement by opening it when user starts filling out the form.

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

During this project the largest problem is time management because we
need to map out everything we need on the website, then develop it in
just a short time. So during the creation of the application, we
divide the project into little parts so it is still manageable.

There is also a tricky part when I was building a like button. I need
to get the latest data on the likes from the database, then increment
it. Also, I need to make a condition where each person can only like
once. In the end, it was successful by utilizing local storage to
store the state.

> ## Lessons Learned

After this project, I felt more comfortable working with firebase.
Before, it seems jarring to set up firebase and firestore connection.
But turns out it was not that hard, also Next.js has a built-in API
route so I can implement SWR caching without the use of another
library.

Because the rest of my team is American, I actually get to practice my
English in this project. It was definitely harder explaining a code
with another language üòÅ.
