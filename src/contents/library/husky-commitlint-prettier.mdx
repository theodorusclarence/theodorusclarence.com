description: 'Configuration to check commit message, and run prettier pre-commit'
---

In this configuration there are 2 things that will be checked

1. Checking the commit message following the [conventional commits](https://theodorusclarence.com/library/conventional-commit-readme), it will fail to commit if the commit message is not following the rule.
2. Writing prettier changes before each commit. This is done to prevent developers that did not have prettier installed in their machine.

## 1. Initialize Husky

```bash
npx husky-init && yarn
```

It will initialize all of the needed files including a sample pre-commit hook.

## 2. Add Commitlint

FIrst, install the dev dependencies

```bash
yarn add -D @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli
```

Then, add this to the husky hook

```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no-install commitlint --edit "$1"'
```

Create commitlint.config.js, you don't need to override the rules if you don't want to

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
  rules: {
    //   TODO Add Scope Enum Here
    // 'scope-enum': [2, 'always', ['yourscope', 'yourscope']],
    'type-enum': [
      2,
      'always',
      [
        'feat',
        'fix',
        'docs',
        'chore',
        'style',
        'refactor',
        'ci',
        'test',
        'revert',
        'perf',
        'vercel',
      ],
    ],
  },
};
```

Commit message will be checked before commit now. 🚀

## 3. Add Lint Staged & Prettier

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn add -D lint-staged prettier
```

Lint staged is used so prettier will not need to check all of the files, but only the staged files.

Add this to package.json

```json
{
  // ...existing code, you can split the html,css,json if you add eslint to configuration
  "lint-staged": {
    "**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html,css,json}": ["yarn prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

Then add this to .husky/pre-commit

```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

yarn lint-staged
```

You can also add test command here if you want to do test before each commit

## 4. Add postmerge hook

Use this to add hook, so husky will run `yarn` everytime we pull changes.

```bash
npx husky add .husky/post-merge 'yarn'
```
