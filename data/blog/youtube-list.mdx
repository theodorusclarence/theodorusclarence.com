## Introduction

May 2020 is the first time I started learning web development. In the beginning, I learn from a [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Angela Yu. In my opinion, that course is really great, but it is a very long course, about 54 hours. This course is really good if you really have no clue about Web Development because she explains it thoroughly.

But, that only course is not enough, there are some materials that are outdated and she teach the styling with bootstrap and skipped the fundamental of CSS. I cover all of that with these youtube channels.

## HTML CSS

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) â†’ This channels cover so many fundamentals of CSS, I learned so much from this channel. I also follow his best practice in writing CSS
- [Design Course](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow) â†’ Focuses on how to design a website
- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) â†’ Really good for beginners because he covers basic stuff

## JavaScript

- [codeSTACKr](https://www.youtube.com/c/codeSTACKr/videos) â†’ Check the [Javascript in 90 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGDK1rpykOQ) series, there are also some crash courses and some fundamental stuff like this, async await, fetch api

## Next.js

## Summary

Learning web development can be very tiring because there are so many things that need to be covered from the very basic like HTML, CSS, JS, then you need to learn Git for version control, frontend framework, styling framework, backend services, database. But, you will eventually understand it with some time.

But, if you enjoy doing web development, watching these videos will feel like entertainment, you learn new stuff every day and keeps investing yourself with knowledge. Also, try to not only watching the video but follow along with the code and make your own project. It was the fastest way to learn for me.

Goodluck! Contact me via email (check the footer) if you need some personal recommendation, I will be glad to help you!
