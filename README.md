## Notice of Revamp

With the revamp in November 2024, the new design and animations repository will not be open-sourced. This is done so I can maintain the originality of the design. You are still allowed to use the new design as inspiration!

This repository will remain open-sourced for you to see the structure and the tech stack I used. There's no significant changes aside from the new design.
